HYDAText is a C++ software to extract time series of streamflow, water level and suspended sediment concentration from the Canada National water data archive (HYDAT). HYDAT is a MS Access database free from download at https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey/data-products-services/national-archive-hydat.html

Although HYDAT is easy manipulable in MS Windows systems, Linux/UNIX users can not extract information direclty from the database because Access files need driver provided by the MS Windows to be read. HYDAText tool has been created  to manipulate the HYDAT database for Linux/UNIX sytem users. Previous to the implementation of HYDAText, HYDAT database tables are extracted using the following steps:
1) Download the *.zip file from the above mentioned link and unzip it within a directory. HYDAT data base is actually HYDAT.mdb file.
2) Save the shell script readHydat.sh within the HYDAT directory and run it. This script will run some Linux/UNIX tools to read MS Access files. The script extracts the tables in text format from Hydat.mdb and save them into the subdirectory tables. Input information to the script is HYDAT MS Access file (Hydat.mdb) and the name of the directory where tables are saved (tables). Tables and variables are explained in *.pdf HYDAT user manual.

How to use HYDAText
1) Download the source code.
2) Run the makefile as 'make' to compile the source code located in 'src/'. The makefile will produce the executable HYDAText. Execute make clean to remove leave-over files after compilation.
3) (OPTIONAL) Create a working directory. 'test' is a example working directory.
4) Within the the working directory, create the file HYDAT.in, whic contain:
- Line 1: Comment
- Line 2: Directory path of HYDAT database location
- Line 3: Comment
- Line 4: Output directory (Usually working directory)
- Line 5: Comment
- line 6: STATION_NUMBER, VARIABLE1, ..., VARIABLE3
- .
- .
- .
- line n: STATION_NUMBER, VARIABLE1, ..., VARIABLE3
Note that VARIABLEi can be: DLY_FLOWS, DLY_LEVELS, SED_DLY_SUSCON
5) Run HYDAText in the console as e.g. './HYDAText test'

HYDAText output and visualization
The model will produce *.csv files named as 'STATION_NUMBER_VARIABLEi.csv'
The script 'plotTS.sh' in 'plot/' can be used to plot the time series in *.csv file in GNUPLOT. To plot, type './plotTS.sh ../test/01AF003_DLY_FLOWS.csv'. this will produce a *.eps file e.g. 01AF003_DLY_FLOWS.eps within e.g. 'test/'.
